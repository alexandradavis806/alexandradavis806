### Hi there 👋

- I’m a graduate of Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp, and I'm currently working as a software engineering intern with a company called RealBlocks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various roles with a focus on full stack and system engineering, as well as product management
- 👯 I have a separate github for my internship role, so that's why my green squares are minimal right now :-)
- 📫 How to reach me: alex.davis806@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
