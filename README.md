**alexandradavis806/alexandradavis806** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Iâ€™m currently working as a software engineering intern with a company called RealBlocks
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various roles with a focus on full stack and system engineering, as well as product management
- ğŸ‘¯ I have a separate github for my internship role, so that's why my green squares are minimal right now :-)
